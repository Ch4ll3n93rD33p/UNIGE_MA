# Exercise 1

## Basic knowledge for Swift

The official documentation of Swift offers a great tour of basic notions in Swift.
Available on: [Swift Tutorial](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html)!      

Let's start by reading it (or fly over it) and try to do the next exercise.

## Exercise

Complete the exercises in the `Sources/Exercice1/Exercice1.swift` file!

### Part 1: Manipulate swift data structures !

Swift has many data structures such as: `List, Set, Dictionnary, ...`

In this exercise, the goal is to use these structures.

### Part 2: Write some functions

#### Fibonacci

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
- `F_0 = 0`
- `F_1 = 1`
- `F_n = F_n-1 + F_n-2`

For instance: `F_10 = 55`

Complete the function `fibo` to compute the Fibonacci sequence in the file `Exercice1.swift` and use the command `swift test` to check if your function passes the test.

#### Palindrom

A palindrome is a word which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.
Complete the function `isPalindrome` which returns if a string is a palindrome in the file `Exercice1.swift` and use the command `swift test` to check if your function passes the test.

### General questions ?

- Why do we use labels in functions ?
- What is type inference ? Does Swift require giving the types every time ?
- Why data structures are so cool ?
- Ask your questions !
