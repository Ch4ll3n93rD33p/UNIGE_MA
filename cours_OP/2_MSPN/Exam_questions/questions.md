## Question 1  

_**How can one describe a natural system in view of a modeling and simulation approach?**_  
_**How are time and space handled?**_  
_**Why does one need various modeling approaches?**_  
_**What do "boundary conditions" and "initial condition" mean?**_  
  
**Natural System**  
Different scales : molecule, cells, tissues, car, traffic, ...  
"You should really adapt your model level to the question and the scale at which you want to answer your problem."  
  
**Space and Time**  
"All the system, they evolve in time and the state of the system may change in place." But sometimes we consider only one of these aspects (e.g. number of individuals -> no space, temperature in a room depending of location -> no time)  

- Time : It is a continuous value and only mathematical models (Diff equations) can deal with it, otherwise we discretize it (time-steps). We might also want to focus only on events. In that case time is not discretized, because you can potentially have any value for the time for the event you're interested in. But you are not looking in a continuous way at your system.  
- Space : Like for time it can be continuous or discretized. There is different ways to do it.  

  - Eulerian approach : the observer sits at a fixed position in space. We attach a physical property or state to each point of the space. (e.g. grid)  
  - Lagrangian approach : the observer takes the point of view of the moving objects. We give the position of all objects of interest as a function over time. (e.g. particles anywhere in the domain)  
  
  **(+)** Complex systems (use of graphs (not physical space))

**Why various modelling approach ?**  
We need various approach to better adapt to the problem ve want to solve as well as the scale needed (often finer than the scale of the question). We may need different models to study the different aspects of a same phenomenon.

**Initial and boundary conditions**  
An initial condition is a value of an evolving variable at some point in time designated as the initial time (typically denoted $t=0$). The boundary conditions are spatial constraint that describe the comportment of the system at the extremities.  
Examples : diffusion equation, lattice gas  

## Question 2  

_**What is a dynamical system and how are they described?**_  
_**Explain the concepts of fixed point, limit cycle and chaos.**_  
_**Give examples.**_  

**Dynamical system**  
It is a system that varies through time, with states $s$.  

- Discrete dynamical systems : They have finite time steps and are defined by recurrence relations. $s(t+\Delta t)=f(s(t))$

- Continuous dynamical systems : They are described by differential equations. $\dot{s} \equiv \frac{ds}{dt}=f(s(t))$

## Question 12  

_**What are the main quantities used to specify a graph?**_  
_**Additionally, define the clustering coefficient and explain its meaning.**_  
_**What does "centrality" mean?**_  

**Graph main quantities**  
A graph is defined by its _nodes_ and _edges_. The number of nodes $n$ is the _order_ of the graph and the number of edges $m$ is the _size_ of the graph.  
The graph can be directed, undirected and weighted.  
It can contain sub-graphs, cliques (a subset of edges of an undirected graph such that every two distinct edge in the clique are adjacent), ... 
We can compute the _adjacency matrix_ $A_{ij}$ : $A_{ij}=1$ if there is a link from $j$ to $i$  
The degree of a node $k_{i}$ is the number of links from it. In directed graphs we define $k_{i}^{in}=\sum_{j}A_{ij}$ and $k_{i}^{out}=\sum_{j}A_{ji}$  
The distance $d_{ij} between two nodes is the length of the shortest path. The diameter $D$ is the maximum distance over all pairs of nodes.


When used to represent a dynamical systems nodes from a graph can have a value that depends on time. They can also change their value according to the value of their neighbors.
$s_{i}(t + \Delta t) = f(\{s_{j}(t)\})$
where $\{s_{j}(t)\})$ is the values of nodes $j$ connected to $i$  

**Clustering coefficient**  
It measures the number of neighbors that are themselves connected. The clustering coefficient $C_{i}$ for node $i$ is defined as $C_{i}=\frac{number~of~pairs~of~neighbors~of~i~that~are~connected}{number~of~pairs~of~neighbors}$

**Centrality**  
Centrality is a measure of the importance of a node with
respect to the others in the graph. There are various centrality metrics :  
- Degree centrality : is simply the degree of the node.
- Eigenvector centrality : the idea of this centrality is that the importance (or score) $x_{i}$ of a node $i$ is determined by the importance of the nodes pointing to it. The score of a node is proportional to the sum of the scores of its incoming neighbors.  
- Closeness centrality : It is defined as the closeness of node i with respect to all the others $C_{i} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j}d_{ij}}=\frac{n}{\sum_{j}d_{ij}}$  
- Betweenness centrality : The betweenness centrality measures the importance of the edges of the graphs. Let $\mathcal{l}$ be an edge and let $n_{ij}^{\mathcal{l}}$ the number of shortest paths between nodes $i$ et $j$ which use edge $\mathcal{l}$. Let $g_{ij}$ be the number of shortest paths between $i$ and $j$.The betweenness centrality is $c_{\mathcal{l}} =\sum_{ij}\frac{n_{ij}^{\mathcal{l}}}{g_{ij}}$
- ... (page rank, katz centrality)

## Question 13  

_**Explain what "assortativity" means in a complex network, and how it can be measured.**_  
_**What is a "community" and how can one determine them?**_  

**Assortativity**  
The concept of assortative mixing describes the tendency of a node to link with the nodes that share the same property. In a social network, links preferably connect similar persons. More rarely, one observes a diassortative mixing, the association of persons with difference : for instance, a marriage is a link between persons of different gender. A network is said to be assortative if a significant fraction of its edges connects nodes sharing a common feature.  

To measure the assortativity of a graph we define the modularity. Let $c_i$ be the attribute of node $i$ in the graph. Let us assume that there are $\mathcal{l} possible attributes : $c_i \in \{1, 2,...,\mathcal{l}\}$.  
$N_m$ is defined as the number of links that connect similar nodes in the sense of the value $c_i$. $N_{m}=\displaystyle\sum_{edges(i,j)}\delta (c_{i},c_{j}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}A_{ij}\delta (c_{i},c_{j})$ where $\delta (c_{i},c_{j})$ the Kronecker function $\delta (x, y) = 1$ if $x=y$, and $0$ otherwise.  
We need to compar it to a reference value. There for we compute $N_{a}$ the expected number of links between similar nodes in a random graph. $N_{a}
= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}\frac{k_i k_j}{2m}\delta (c_{i},c_{j})$ where $k_i$ is the degree of node $i$, $2m$ the number of edge extremities to be connected and $\frac{k_i k_j}{2m}$ is the expected number of links between $i$ and $j$.  
if $Q =\frac{N_{m}-N_{a}}{m}$ the modularity is greater than 0 there is assortativity, otherwise deassortativity

**Community**  
We call communities a group of nodes that have more
in common together than with nodes in another community. A community is a sub-graph.
